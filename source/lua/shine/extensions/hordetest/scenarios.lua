--[[ Horde TEST harness — scenario registry.

     Each scenario is a function that raises through Plugin.Assert.*. Add new ones
     here as beads land them; the runner executes them in registration order and
     defers frame-resolved checks with Plugin:Defer.

     'negative_control' is flagged Expected and therefore MUST fail: it proves the
     asserts fire, the runner detects the raise, and test.sh parses a FAIL. If it
     ever passes, the harness is lying about green.

     Cross-extension state is read through Shine.Plugins[Name] (verified accessor,
     core/shared/extensions.lua:1040 + :1121) — never a test-only global. ]]
